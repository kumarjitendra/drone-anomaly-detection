The "Image location" (or "Inference image URI") : 

For most use cases, you'll use a pre-built SageMaker Docker image that includes popular machine learning frameworks. These images are hosted by AWS in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Here's how to find the "Image location" you need:

Understanding SageMaker's Pre-built Images:

SageMaker provides Docker images for various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.) and their versions. When you create your model.tar.gz with your inference.py script, SageMaker expects your inference.py to be compatible with one of these pre-built images.

How to Find the Correct Image URI (Console Method):

Determine your Model's Framework and Python Version:

What machine learning framework did you use to train your "drone model"? (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)

What Python version did you use for your inference.py script and model (e.g., Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)?

Go to the AWS SageMaker Documentation for Pre-built Images:
The most reliable source is the official AWS documentation. Search for "SageMaker pre-built Docker images" or "SageMaker inference container images".
A good starting point is usually:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ecr-repositories.html

Locate Your Image URI:

On that documentation page, you'll see tables or lists categorized by framework (e.g., "Deep Learning Containers," "Scikit-learn," "XGBoost").

Navigate to the section for your chosen framework.

Find the image URI that matches:

Your AWS Region (e.g., us-east-3).

Your Framework (e.g., pytorch-inference, tensorflow-inference, sklearn-inference).

Your Framework Version (e.g., 2.0.1, 2.15.0, 1.2-1).

Your Python Version (e.g., py310).

Whether you need a CPU or GPU image (most inference often starts with CPU unless high throughput/latency is critical and you have a GPU model).

Example (for PyTorch 2.0.1, Python 3.10, CPU in us-east-1):
You might find an image URI like:
763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pytorch-inference:2.0.1-cpu-py310

Example (for Scikit-learn 1.2-1, Python 3.9, CPU in us-east-1):
You might find an image URI like:
683313688378.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-scikit-learn:1.2-1-cpu-py39-ubuntu20.04

Important: The account ID (e.g., 763104351884 or 683313688378) at the beginning of the URI is specific to AWS and the service, you'll copy the entire string.
